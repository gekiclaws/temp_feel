A predictive system that correlates clothing choices with physiological data and weather conditions to optimize outdoor comfort.

I developed this solution to reliably predict my thermal comfort based on physiological state and weather conditions. After collecting data and building a Python classifier, I created:
1. A Flask API to serve predictions from the Python classifier
2. A Java client library with type-safe interfaces for consuming the predictions
3. A lightweight frontend for easy access to comfort predictions

This multi-layered architecture provides both programmatic access and user-friendly interfaces to thermal comfort predictions for outdoor activities.
