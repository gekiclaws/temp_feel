- Should the TempFeelConfig class be made immutable?
- Review the numeric types. Is double best for clo? Is unsigned byte available in java for HR?
- Is it more efficient to maintain a mapping of the field-value pairs in string-fied form for later JSON processing or only make the map/json when the user
makes calls to the classifiers? (i.e. is creating a brand new map every time or modifying maps with each set more efficient design)
